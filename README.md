This is a simple app showing the schedule of the Israeli Acrobatics Convention.

The app is hosted on Heroku and based on: github.com:heroku/node-js-getting-started

The formatting of the table to the different formats is done in [Lamdu](http://github.com/lamdu/lamdu), which is transliterated to Javascript. The file `source.lamdu` can be loaded into the Lamdu environment for editing. It isn't very readable otherwise because Lamdu stores code in a database rather than in a text format.
